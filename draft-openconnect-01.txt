                The OpenConnect VPN Protocol Version 1.0
                          draft-openconnect-01

Abstract

   This document specifies version 1.0 of the OpenConnect Virtual
   Private Network (VPN) protocol, a secure VPN protocol that provides
   communications privacy over the Internet.  That protocol is believed
   to be compatible with CISCO's AnyConnect VPN protocol.  The protocol
   allows the establishment of VPN tunnels in a way that is designed to
   prevent eavesdropping, tampering, or message forgery.

1.  Introduction

   The purpose of this document is to specify the OpenConnect VPN
   protocol in a detail in order to allow for multiple interoperable
   implementations.  This is the protocol used by the OpenConnect client
   and server [OPENCONNECT], and is believed to be compatible with
   CISCO's AnyConnect protocol.

   While there are many competing VPN protocol solutions, none of them
   was ever described in a publicly available document.  Even open
   source VPN solutions have their source code as the primary
   description of their protocol.  That allowed no easy study of each
   protocol's properties and weaknesses, and that is the secondary goal
   of this document, to describe a deployed TLS based [RFC5246] VPN
   protocol.

1.1.  Requirements Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.2.  Goals of This Document

   The OpenConnect protocol version 1.0 specification is intended
   primarily for readers who will be implementing the protocol and those
   doing cryptographic analysis of it.

2.  The OpenConnect Protocol

   The OpenConnect protocol combines the TLS protocol [RFC5246],
   datagram TLS protocol [RFC6347] and HTTP protocols [RFC2616] to
   provide an Internet-Layer VPN channel.  The channel is designed to
   operate using UDP packets, and fallback on TCP if that's not
   possible.

   In brief the protocol initiates an HTTP over TLS connection on a
   known port, where client authentication is performed.  After this
   step, the client initiates an HTTP CONNECT command to establish a VPN
   channel over TCP.  A secondary VPN channel over UDP will be
   established using information provided by the server using HTTP
   headers.  At that point the raw IP packets flow, over the VPN
   channels.

2.1.  VPN Session Establishment

   The client and server establish a TLS connection over a known port,
   typically over 443, the port used for HTTPS.  The client SHOULD
   negotiate TLS 1.1 or later, and support the following TLS protocol
   extensions.

      Server Name Indication [RFC6066]: the client SHOULD provide the
      DNS name of the server in the TLS handshake.

      Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation [RFC7301]: the client MAY
      provide this protocol name.  The protocol name to be used is
      defined in Appendix A.

2.1.1.  Server Authentication

   In the OpenConnect VPN protocol, the server is always authenticated
   using its certificate.  Once a client establishes a TCP connection to
   the server's well known port, it initiates the TLS protocol.  In the
   first connection to the server, the client SHOULD verify the provided
   by the server certificate, and SHOULD store its public key for
   verification of subsequent sessions.  Thus, subsequent sessions
   SHOULD check whether the server's key match the initial.

Internet-Draft         The OpenConnect Version 1.0              May 2015


   The server's identity in the certificate SHOULD be placed in the
   certificate's SubjectAlternativeName field, and unless a special
   profile is assumed, it will be of type DNSName.

2.1.2.  Client Authentication

   The OpenConnect VPN protocol allows for the following types of client
   authentication, or combinations of them.

   1.  Password: a user can authenticate itself using a password.

   2.  Certificate: a user can authenticate itself using a PKIX
       certificate it possesses.

   3.  HTTP SPNEGO: a user can authenticate itself using a Kerberos
       ticket, or any other mechanism supported by SPNEGO (i.e.,
       GSSAPI).

   The server is authenticated to the client using a PKIX certificate
   presented during the TLS negotiation.

   It is important to note that during the password and HTTP SPNEGO
   authentication methods, any headers allowed by the HTTP protocol can
   be present.  In fact, there are legacy clients which assume that the
   server will keep a state using cookies, and send their username and
   password in different TLS and HTTP connections.  This practice
   prevents the server from binding the TLS channel with the VPN session
   [RFC5056], and is discouraged.  It is RECOMMENDED for clients to
   complete authentication in the same TLS session, and rely on TLS
   session resumption if reconnections to the server are needed.

   After the TLS session is established the client irrespective of the
   supported authentication methods, should send an HTTP POST request on
   "/" with a config-auth XML structure of type 'init'.  An example of
   its contents follow.

       <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
       <!DOCTYPE config-auth SYSTEM "config-auth.dtd">
       <config-auth client="vpn" type="init">
           <version who="vpn">v5.01</version>
       </config-auth>

   The precise DTD declarations for the contents of XML messages defined
   in this document are listed in Appendix C.  Also the HTTP Content-
   Type to be used for these XML structures MUST be 'text/xml'.

2.1.2.1.  Authentication using certificates

   During the initial TLS protocol handshake the server may require a
   client certificate to be presented, depending on its configuration.

   Because the client certificate is sent in the clear during the
   handshake it SHOULD NOT contain other identifying information other
   than a username, or a pseudonymus identifier.  It is RECOMMENDED to
   place the user identifier in the DN field of the certificate, using
   the UID object identifier (0.9.2342.19200300.100.1.1) [RFC4519].

   After the TLS session is established and the the config-auth XML
   structure of type 'init' is sent, the server should send it reply.
   If the certificate sent by the client was successfully validated, it
   should reply using the HTTP response code 200, and the contents of
   the reply should be a config-auth XML structure of type 'complete',
   as follows.

       <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
       <!DOCTYPE config-auth SYSTEM "config-auth.dtd">
       <config-auth client="vpn" type="complete">
         <version who="sg">0.1(1)</version>
         <auth id="success">
           <title>SSL VPN Service</title>
         </auth>
       </config-auth>

   In that case the client should proceed to the establishment of the
   primary channel as in Section 2.1.4.

2.1.2.2.  Authentication using passwords

   After the TLS session is established and the the config-auth XML
   structure of type 'init' is sent, the server will reply using forms
   the client software should prompt the user to fill in.  Its reply
   utilizes a config-auth XML structure of type 'auth-request'.

     <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
     <!DOCTYPE auth SYSTEM "config-auth.dtd">
     <config-auth client="vpn" type="auth-request">
         <auth id="main">
             <message>Please enter your username</message>
             <form action="/auth" method="post">
                 <input label="Username:" name="username" type="text" />
             </form>
         </auth>
     </config-auth>

   The client may be asked to provide the information in separate forms
   as above, or may be asked combined as below.

      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
      <!DOCTYPE auth SYSTEM "config-auth.dtd">
      <config-auth client="vpn" type="auth-request">
        <auth id="main">
          <message>Please enter your username</message>
          <form action="/auth" method="post">
              <input label="Username:" name="username" type="text"/>
              <input label="Password:" name="password" type="password"/>
          </form>
        </auth>
      </config-auth>

   The client software will then fill in the provided form and sent it
   back to the server using an HTTP POST on the location specified by
   the server (in the above examples it was "/auth").  The reply would
   then be of type 'auth-reply' as in the following example.

       <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
       <!DOCTYPE config-auth SYSTEM "config-auth.dtd">
       <config-auth client="vpn" type="auth-reply">
           <version who="vpn">v5.01</version>
           <auth><username>test</username>
           </auth>
       </config-auth>

   As mentioned above, the server may ask repeatedly for information
   until it believes the user is authenticated.  For example, the server
   could present a second form asking for the password, after the
   username is provided, or ask for a second password if that is
   necessary.  In these cases the server should respond with an HTTP 200
   OK status code, and proceed sending its new request.

   If client authentication fails, the server MUST respond with an HTTP
   401 unauthorized status code.  Otherwise, on successful
   authentication the server should reply with a 200 HTTP code and use
   the authentication complete structure as in Section 2.1.2.1.

   An example session is shown in figure Figure 1.

2.1.2.3.  HTTP Authentication using SPNEGO

   That type of authentication is performed using the HTTP SPNEGO
   protocol [RFC4559], a method which is available using the Generic
   Security Service API [RFC2743].  The following approach is used to
   advertise the availability of the HTTP SPNEGO protocol by the client.
   A client which supports the HTTP SPNEGO protocol, SHOULD indicate it
   using the following header on in its initial request to the server
   with the config-auth 'init' XML structure.

       X-Support-HTTP-Auth: true

   After that the server would report a "401 Unauthorized" status code
   and authentication would proceed as specified in the HTTP SPNEGO
   protocol.  The server may utilize the following header, to indicate
   that alternative authentication methods are available (e.g., with
   plain password), if authentication fails.

       X-Support-HTTP-Auth: fallback

   If client authentication fails, the server MUST respond with an HTTP
   401 unauthorized status code.  In that case, a client which received
   the previous header should retry authenticating to the server without
   sending the "X-Support-HTTP-Auth: true" header.

   Otherwise, on successful authentication the server should reply with
   a 200 HTTP code and use the authentication complete structure as in
   Section 2.1.2.1.

2.1.3.  Exchange of Session Parameters

   By the receipt of a success XML structure, the client SHOULD issue an
   HTTP CONNECT request.  In addition it may provide the following
   headers.

      X-CSTP-Address-Type: A comma separated list of the requested
      address types.

         IPv4: when the client only supports IPv4 addresses.

         IPv6: when the client only supports IPv6 addresses.

         IPv4,IPv6: when the client supports both types of IP addresses.

      X-CSTP-Base-MTU: The MTU of the link as estimated by the client.

      X-CSTP-Accept-Encoding: A comma separated list of accepted
      compression algorithms for the CSTP channel.

      User-Agent: A string identifying the client software.

   For the options related to compression see Appendix B for more
   information.

   An example CONNECT request is shown below.

       User-Agent: Open AnyConnect VPN Agent v5.01
       X-CSTP-Base-MTU: 1280
       X-CSTP-Address-Type: IPv4,IPv6
       CONNECT /CSCOSSLC/tunnel HTTP/1.1

   After a successful receipt of an HTTP CONNECT request, the server
   should reply and provide the client with configuration parameters.
   The available options follow.

      X-CSTP-Address: The IPv4 address of the client, if IPv4 has been
      requested.

      X-CSTP-Netmask: An IPv4 netmask to be pushed to the client, if
      IPv4 has been requested.  This should contain the mask on the
      P-t-P link and is RECOMMENDED the server address to be the first
      in defined network.

      X-CSTP-Address-IP6: The IPv6 address of the client in CIDR
      notation, if IPv6 has been requested.  The prefix length is
      RECOMMENDED to be set to 127-bits according to [RFC6164].

      X-CSTP-DNS: The IP address of a DNS server that can be used for
      that session.

      X-CSTP-Default-Domain: The DNS domains the provided DNS servers
      respond for.

      X-CSTP-Split-Include: The network address of a route which is
      provided by this server.

      X-CSTP-Split-Exclude: The network address of a route that is not
      provided by this server.

      X-CSTP-Base-MTU: The MTU of the link as estimated by this server.

      X-CSTP-DynDNS: Set to "true" if the server is operating with a
      dynamic DNS address.

      X-CSTP-Content-Encoding: if present is it set to one of the values
      presented by the client in 'X-CSTP-Accept-Encoding' header.  It
      will be the compression algorithm used in the CSTP channel.

      X-DTLS-Content-Encoding: if present is it set to one of the values
      presented by the client in 'X-DTLS-Accept-Encoding' header.  It
      will be the compression algorithm used in the DTLS channel.

   The client is expected to treat the received parameters as his
   networking settings.  If no "X-CSTP-Split-Include" headers are
   present, the client is expected to assign its default route through
   the VPN.

2.1.4.  Establishment of Primary TCP Channel (CSTP)

   The previous HTTP message is the last HTTP message sent by the
   server.  After that message, the established TCP channel is used to
   transport IP packets between the client and the server.  The
   transferred packets encoding is discussed in Section 2.2.  This
   channel will be referred as CSTP in the rest of this document.

2.1.5.  Establishment of Secondary UDP Channel (DTLS)

   To establish the secondary UDP-based channel, which will be referred
   to as the DTLS channel, the client must advertise support for it
   during the issue of the HTTP CONNECT request (see Section 2.1.3.
   This is done by appending the following headers to the request.

      X-DTLS-Accept-Encoding: A comma separated list of accepted
      compression algorithms for the DTLS channel.

      X-DTLS-Master-Secret: A hex encoded pre-master secret to be used
      for the DTLS session.

      X-DTLS-CipherSuite: A colon-separated list of ciphers (e.g., the
      string AES256-SHA:AES128-SHA:DES-CBC3-SHA).

   The DTLS established DTLS channel utilizes session resumption as a
   method for preshared-key authentication.  That is the value presented
   in X-DTLS-Master-Secret is set as a master secret to be resumed.  The
   session ID value is sent by the server on the response to CONNECT
   using the 'X-DTLS-Session-ID' header.  That header provides a hex-
   encoded value of the DTLS session ID to be used by the client.  The
   following headers are used by the server's response to CONNECT, and
   are related to the DTLS channel establishment.

      X-DTLS-Session-ID: A hex encoded value to be used as a DTLS
      session ID by the client.  It also serves as an identifier for the
      server to associate the incoming DTLS session with the TLS
      session.

      X-DTLS-Port: The port number to which the client should send UDP
      packets for DTLS.

      X-DTLS-CipherSuite: The ciphersuite selected by the server.  It
      should be one of the options present in the client's X-DTLS-
      CipherSuite header.

      X-DTLS-Rekey-Time: The time (in seconds) after which the DTLS
      session should rekey, see Section 2.4.

      X-DTLS-Rekey-Method: The method used in DTLS rekey, see
      Section 2.4.

   The following table lists the ciphers negotiated via the X-DTLS-
   CipherSuite header, and the corresponding DTLS ciphersuite.

                                  Table 3

2.3.  The DTLS Channel Protocol

   The format of the packets sent over the UDP channel consists of an
   1-byte header followed by data.  The header byte indicates the type
   of data that follow as in Table 3.  The header and the data are
   encapsulated in a DTLS record packet (see [RFC6347]).

2.4.  The Channel Re-Key Protocol

   During the exchange of session parameters (Section 2.1.3), the server
   advertizes the methods available for session rekey using the "X-CSTP-
   Rekey-Method" and "X-DTLS-Rekey-Method" HTTP headers.  The available
   options for both the server and client are listed below.

   1.  none: no rekey; the session will go on until 2^48 DTLS records
       have been exchanged, or 2^64 TLS records.

Internet-Draft         The OpenConnect Version 1.0              May 2015


   2.  ssl: a TLS or DTLS rehandshake will be performed periodically.

   3.  new-tunnel: the session will tear down and the client will
       reconnect periodically.

   When the value is other than "none" the rekey period is determinated
   by the "X-CSTP-Rekey-Time" and "X-DTLS-Rekey-Time" headers.  These
   headers contain the time in seconds after which a session should
   rekey.

   It should be noted that when the "ssl" rekey option is used, care
   must be taken by both the client and the server to ensure that either
   safe renegotiation is used ([RFC5746]), or that the identity of the
   peer remained the same.

2.5.  The Keepalive and Dead Peer Detection Protocols

   In OpenConnect there are two packet types that can be used for keep-
   alive or dead peer detection, as shown in Table 3.  These are the
   DPD-REQ and KeepAlive packets.

   The timings of the transmission of these packets are set by the
   server, and they are advisory to a client.  However, any peer
   receiving these packets MUST response with the appropriate packet.
   For DPD-REQ packets, the response MUST be DPD-RESP, and for KeepAlive
   packets the response must be another KeepAlive packet.  The main
   difference between these two types of packets, is that the DPD
   packets allow for arbitrary data to be attached, making them suitable
   for Path MTU detection.

   The server advertizes the suggested periods during the exchange of
   session parameters (Section 2.1.3).  The available headers are listed
   below.

      X-CSTP-DPD: applicable to CSTP channel; contains a relative time
      in seconds.

      X-CSTP-Keepalive: applicable to CSTP channel; contains a relative
      time in seconds.

      X-DTLS-DPD: applicable to DTLS channel; contains a relative time
      in seconds.

      X-DTLS-Keepalive: applicable to DTLS channel; contains a relative
      time in seconds.

3.  Security Considerations

   This document provides a description of a protocol to establish a VPN
   over a TLS channel.  All security considerations of the referenced
   documents in particular [RFC5246] and [RFC6347] are applicable, in
   addition the following considerations.

   The protocol is designed to be as compatible as possible with a
   legacy VPN protocol and as such it carries cruft, such as partial
   dependence on a non-standard DTLS version, and utilization of an
   awkward method to establish a DTLS session which relies on session
   resumption.  Nevertheless, these particularities are not believed to
   cause a degradation of the overall protocol security, and could be
   addressed with a backwards compatible protocol upgrade.

   The protocol provides a VPN channel which carries payload hidden from
   eavesdroppers.  However, the payload's length remain visible and in
   certain scenarios that may be sufficient to determine the transferred
   payload.  Furthermore, there are scenarios where compressed payload
   lengths may reveal more information than the uncompressed data
   [COMP-ISSUES][COMP-ISSUES2].  For that we RECOMMEND that
   implementations don't enable compression by default, and only allow
   it after notifying the users and administrators about the
   consequences.

   This protocol could sometimes be used because of the fact that it
   ressembles the TLS protocol and thus is not detected by the available
   VPN blockers.  While an implementation could intentionally masquerade
   its packets to ressemble a typical HTTPS session, a fully compliant
   implementation will be distinct from an average HTTP session due to
   the DTLS session establishment, and the transferred packet sizes.

   For certificate authentication OpenConnect relies on the TLS
   protocol.  However, as mentioned in the text, TLS version 1.2 and
   earlier do not protect the client's (or the server's) certificate
   from eavesdroppers.  For that it is RECOMMENDED that certificates to
   be used with this protocol contain the minimum possible identifying
   information.

      Protocol:  openconnect-vpn/1.0
      Identification Sequence:

Appendix B.  Compression

   The available compression algorithms for the CSTP and DTLS channels
   are shown in Table 4.  Note, that all algorithms are intentionally
   stateless to prevent the influence of independent packets (e.g., from
   different sources) on each others compression.  That does not
   eliminate all known attacks on compression before encryption, and for
   that reason an implentation MUST NOT enable compression by default.

   After compression is negotiated each side may choose to compress the
   payload and use the 'COMPRESSED DATA' header from Table 3, or may
   send uncompressed data with the 'DATA' payload.  Each side MUST be
   able to process both payloads.
